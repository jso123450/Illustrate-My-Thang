# Description
- A remake of OMGPOP's "Draw My Thing." It will feature a site hosted on a server into which users can connect into different game rooms, and play. Each player will have a turn, with a limited amount of time, in which they are given a word to draw. The other players will have to guess the word, and if they do, they will get points.

# Features
- Python/Flask, hosted with Green Unicorn (maybe?)
- Database Management
- Web Sockets
