# Team Members
(not entirely sure what would constitute front/back/middle rightnow)
- Leader: Johnny So
- Javascript: Ho Yin Ho
- Websockets: Kah Soon Yap
- Middleware: Javis Wu

# Work Sequence
- set up the chatroom
- make a send button so that it will send the div/html element that contains the picture drawn to the server and push it to the clients (as json??)
- take out the button, but make a timer that will call the function
- implement game rules

# Description
- A remake of OMGPOP's "Draw My Thing." It will feature a site hosted on a server into which users can connect into different game rooms, and play. Each player will have a turn, with a limited amount of time, in which they are given a word to draw. The other players will have to guess the word, and if they do, they will get points.

# How It Works
- WebSockets used for Networking
- Hosted on a DigitalOcean server
- Javascript for an interactive UI experience
- Database Management

- We started by taking a look at and will be using it as a reference for our chatroom
