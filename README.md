# Description
- A remake of OMGPOP's "Draw My Thing." It will feature a site hosted on a server into which users can connect into different game rooms, and play. Each player will have a turn, with a limited amount of time, in which they are given a word to draw. The other players will have to guess the word, and if they do, they will get points.

# How It Works
- WebSockets used for Networking
- Hosted on a DigitalOcean server
- Javascript for an interactive UI experience
- Database Management
